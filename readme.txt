Hey 

This is just one of the simple approaches to the titanic dataset from kaggle(link below)

https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

I have tended to cleaning the data,  a bit of feature engineering and used 3 Sklearn packages

1.Logistic Regression
2.XGBoost Classifier
3.Random Forrest Classifier

If you have any doubts let me know or if you have any suggestions of optimising my code feel free to do so

Regards
